## üìã How to Test Each Script in Airtable

### Step 1: Basic Setup (Do This Once)
1. **Open your Airtable base**
2. **Add the Scripting extension**:
   - Click the "Extensions" button (puzzle piece icon)
   - Click "Add an extension"
   - Search for "Scripting" and install it
3. **Open the Scripting extension**

### Step 2: Create Base Configuration (Do This First)
1. **In Scripting extension, click "Create a new script"**
2. **Name it**: "Base Configuration"
3. **Copy and paste this code**:

```javascript
// Base Configuration - Run this first
const FIELDS = {
    BUILD_VERSION_UNIFIED: 'Build Version (Unified)',
    PRIORITY: 'Priority',
    URGENCY_CUSTOM_FIELD: 'Urgency',
    QA_STATE: 'QA State',
    HOTFIX_CREATED_FIELD: 'Created',
    HOTFIX_RESOLVED_FIELD: 'Resolved',
    HL_TO_PD_FLAG: 'HL to PD Flag',
    PD_TO_CERT_SUB_FLAG: 'PD to Cert Sub Flag',
    CERT_SUB_TO_LIVE_FLAG: 'Cert Sub to Live Flag',
    LIVE_PLUS_FLAG: 'Live+ Flag',
    INTEGRATION_AREA: 'Integration Area',
    INTEGRATION_PLATFORM: 'Integration Platform',
    INTEGRATION_FN_DOMAIN: 'Integration FN Domain',
    INTEGRATION_REQUESTOR: 'Integration Requestor',
    INTEGRATION_CREATED_FIELD: 'Created',
    INTEGRATION_RESOLVED_FIELD: 'Resolved',
    RQA_FIX_VERSION: 'Fix Version/s',

    COMMITS_HL_TO_PD: 'Commits - HL to PD',
    COMMITS_PD_TO_CERT: 'Commits - PD to Cert',
    COMMITS_CERT_TO_LIVE: 'Commits - Cert to Live',
    COMMITS_LIVE_PLUS: 'Commits - Live+',
    MS_HARD_LOCK: 'HL Date',
    MS_PENCILS_DOWN: 'PD Date', 
    MS_CERT: 'Cert Sub Date',
    MS_LIVE: 'Live Date',
    DEPLOY_CLASSIFICATION: 'Deploy Classification'
};

const CONFIG = {
    HOTFIX_QA_VERIFIED_TARGET_PERCENT: 80,
    INTEGRATION_PIPELINE_TARGET_DAYS: 14,
    MILESTONE_ADHERENCE_TARGET_PERCENT: 75
};

console.log("Base configuration loaded successfully!");
console.log("You can now run the individual report scripts.");

// Store for other scripts to use
globalThis.AIRTABLE_FIELDS = FIELDS;
globalThis.AIRTABLE_CONFIG = CONFIG;
```

4. **Click "Run script"** - you should see "Base configuration loaded successfully!"

### Step 3: Test Individual Scripts

#### To Test the **Deploy Tracker Replacement**:
1. **Create new script**: "Deploy Tracker Test"
2. **Copy the entire content** from `realtime-release-monitor.js`
3. **Find this line** near the top:
   ```javascript
   const { FIELDS, CONFIG } = require('./current/versionreport.js');
   ```
4. **Replace it with**:
   ```javascript
   const FIELDS = globalThis.AIRTABLE_FIELDS;
   const CONFIG = globalThis.AIRTABLE_CONFIG;
   ```
5. **Scroll to the bottom** and find the example usage
6. **Change the version** from `'36.30'` to your current version (like `'37.00'`)
7. **Click "Run script"**
8. **You should see**: Real-time dashboard output with your current release data

#### To Test **Work Volume Report** (for milestone adherence):
1. **Create new script**: "Work Volume Test"
2. **Copy the entire content** from `work-volume-report.js`
3. **Replace the require line** (same as above)
4. **Change the version** in the example at the bottom
5. **Click "Run script"**
6. **You should see**: Work intensity analysis showing team overload

#### To Test **Milestone Adherence Report**:
1. **Create new script**: "Milestone Test"
2. **Copy the entire content** from `milestone-adherence-report.js`
3. **Replace the require line** (same as above)
4. **Click "Run script"**
5. **You should see**: Analysis of which teams miss milestones

#### To Test **Enhanced Version Report**:
1. **Create new script**: "Enhanced Version Test"
2. **Copy the entire content** from `enhanced-version-report.js`
3. **Replace the require line** (same as above)
4. **Change the version** in the example usage
5. **Click "Run script"**
6. **You should see**: Enhanced version of your current report with trends

### **Optional/Advanced**:
9. **Season Report**
10. **Component Team Report**
11. **Release Readiness Report**

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### If You Get an Error:
1. **Check the field names**: The script uses field names like `'Build Version (Unified)'` - make sure these match your Airtable exactly
2. **Try a different version**: If `'36.30'` doesn't exist, change it to a version that does exist in your data
3. **Check the base configuration**: Make sure you ran the "Base Configuration" script first

### Common Error Messages:
- **"Field not found"**: The script is looking for a field that doesn't exist or is named differently
- **"Table not found"**: Make sure you're running this in the right Airtable base
- **"No data found"**: Try changing the version number to one that exists

### Field Name Differences:
If you get field errors, you might need to update the field names in the Base Configuration. Common differences:
- `'Build Version (Unified)'` might be `'Version'` in your base
- `'Created'` might be `'Date Created'`
- `'Priority'` might be `'Issue Priority'`

## üìû Need Help?

### **If Scripts Don't Work**:
1. Double-check you ran "Base Configuration" first
2. Verify the version number exists in your data
3. Check that field names match exactly
4. Try with a simpler script first (like Enhanced Version Report)

### **If You Want to Modify**:
- You don't need to understand the code
- Just change version numbers, field names, or date ranges in the examples
- The scripts are designed to be safe to run multiple times

### **Ready for Production**:
Once scripts work in testing, you can set them up as automations using the **Airtable Setup Guide** document for full deployment.
