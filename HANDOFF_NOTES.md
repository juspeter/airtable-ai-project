## 🔄 **Next Session Priorities**

### **Immediate Tasks (Pick up here):**

1. **Grafana Data Table Issues** 🚨
   - **Problem**: Commit milestone counting between releases
   - **Need**: Airtable script analysis + Workato recipe review
   - **Action**: Share public Workato recipe links for Grafana integration

2. **Open Issues Table Issues** 🚨  
   - **Problem**: Issue tracking and JIRA integration
   - **Need**: Airtable script analysis + Workato recipe review
   - **Action**: Share public Workato recipe links for Open Issues workflow

### **How to Share Workato Recipes:**
1. In Workato, find your recipes for:
   - Grafana Data (commit counting)
   - Open Issues (JIRA integration)
2. Look for "Share" or "Public View" options
3. Generate shareable links
4. I can fetch and analyze them with WebFetch tool

### **Also Need (if possible):**
- Copy Airtable script code for both tables
- Save as `grafana-data-script.js` and `open-issues-script.js` in scripts/ folder
