# Fortnite Release Management - Airtable AI Project

A comprehensive AI-powered automation system for Epic Games' Fortnite release management workflows.

## 🎯 Project Overview

This project transforms manual Excel-based release management into an intelligent, automated Airtable system with AI-powered insights, predictive analytics, and workflow automation.

## ✅ Current Status

- ✅ **Connected to Airtable** - All 16 tables analyzed and accessible
- ✅ **AI Analysis Tools** - Release health prediction, incident pattern analysis
- ✅ **Workflow Analysis** - 200+ tasks across Operations/Production/Submissions teams
- ✅ **Automation Design** - Complete 7-table structure with 8 smart automations
- ✅ **Script Validation** - versionreport.txt working perfectly

## 🚀 Quick Start

### 1. Setup API Credentials

Edit the `.env` file:
```
AIRTABLE_API_KEY=your_airtable_api_key_here
AIRTABLE_BASE_ID=your_base_id_here
```

### 2. Test Connection

```bash
npm install
npm run scan
```

### 3. Run AI Analysis

```bash
node scripts/ai-analysis-framework.js
node scripts/release-health-predictor.js
node scripts/incident-pattern-analyzer.js
```

- **Incident Pattern Analysis** - Identify temporal patterns and component hotspots  
- **Integration Risk Assessment** - Flag high-risk integrations and timing
- **Automated Reporting** - Generate comprehensive release reports

## 🎯 Automation Roadmap

### Phase 1: Core Structure (2-3 weeks)
- Migrate checklist templates to Airtable
- Implement basic task generation and tracking
- Set up milestone-driven due dates

### Phase 2: Smart Automation (2-3 weeks)  
- Dependency management and auto-task progression
- Slack notifications and approval workflows
- Overdue alerts and escalation

### Phase 3: External Integration (3-4 weeks)
- JIRA sync for issue tracking and dashboards
- Grafana metrics automation (eliminate manual data entry)
- Perforce integration for version verification

### Phase 4: Advanced AI (2-3 weeks)
- Predictive risk assessment and timeline adjustments
- Automated compliance checking
- Real-time release health dashboards

## 🔒 Security

- API keys stored locally, not in git
- Sensitive analysis data excluded from commits
- All Fortnite-specific data properly secured

## 📝 Next Steps

1. **Resolve Grafana Data issues** - Fix commit counting between milestones
2. **Fix Open Issues integration** - Resolve JIRA sync problems  
3. **Begin Phase 1 implementation** - Start core Airtable automation

## 🤝 Team Impact

**Current**: 200+ manual tasks, Excel coordination, manual metrics collection  
**Future**: Intelligent automation, real-time visibility, predictive insights

**Estimated Savings**: 60-80% reduction in manual release coordination effort
