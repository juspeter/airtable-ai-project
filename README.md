# 🚀 Airtable Release Management System

**A comprehensive reporting and automation system for release management workflows using Airtable data.**

## 📋 Project Overview

This project provides intelligent reporting tools and automation solutions for release management. It transforms manual tracking into automated insights with:

- **Real-time release monitoring** (Deploy Tracker replacement)
- **Team workload analysis** (identifying milestone adherence issues)
- **Incident prevention insights** (ShitHappens analysis)
- **Pipeline bottleneck identification** (Integration flow analysis)
- **Predictive risk assessment** (milestone and component risk)

## ✅ Production-Ready Reports

### 🔥 **High-Priority Reports** (Immediate Value)
- **Real-Time Release Monitor** - Replaces Deploy Tracker Google Sheet
- **Work Volume Report** - Identifies teams missing milestones due to overload
- **Milestone Adherence Report** - Analyzes teams consistently missing deadlines
- **Hotfix Velocity Report** - Response time and QA turnaround analysis

### 📊 **Specialized Analysis Reports**
- **ShitHappens Analysis** - Incident patterns and prevention opportunities
- **Integration Pipeline Report** - HL→PD→Cert→Live bottleneck analysis
- **Enhanced Version Report** - Improved version of existing reports
- **Component Team Report** - Deep-dive on specific component performance

## 🚀 Quick Start

### 1. **Environment Setup**
Copy `.env.template` to `.env` and add your credentials:
```bash
AIRTABLE_API_KEY=your_airtable_api_key_here
AIRTABLE_BASE_ID=your_base_id_here
```

### 2. **Install Dependencies**
```bash
npm install
```

### 3. **Test Scripts** (No coding knowledge required)
Follow the **[Scripts Guide](scripts/SCRIPT_GUIDE.md)** for copy-paste instructions to test each report in Airtable's Scripting extension.

### 4. **Production Setup**
Use the **[Complete Setup Guide](docs/airtable-setup-guide.md)** for full implementation with interfaces and automations.

## 📊 Data Requirements

**✅ Compatible with your existing Airtable structure:**
- 16 tables including Builds, Hotfixes, Integrations, ShitHappens
- 98 fields in Builds table with milestone dates and metrics
- Integration pipeline flags (HL to PD, PD to Cert, etc.)
- Component tracking and team assignment data

**See [Data Viability Assessment](analysis/data-viability-assessment.md) for detailed compatibility analysis.**

## 🔒 Security & Privacy

- ✅ **API keys protected** - `.env` file excluded from Git
- ✅ **No sensitive data** - Only code and documentation in repository
- ✅ **Local data only** - All Airtable data remains in your base
- ✅ **Safe to share** - Repository contains no confidential information

## 🤖 Claude AI Integration

This project includes MCP (Model Context Protocol) server setup for seamless Claude integration:
- Direct Airtable data access through Claude
- Context-aware assistance with report interpretation
- Interactive debugging and customization support

## 📈 Expected Impact

**Immediate Benefits:**
- Replace Deploy Tracker Google Sheet with real-time Airtable interface
- Identify teams at risk of missing milestones before delays occur
- Reduce incident volume through predictive component risk analysis

**Long-term Value:**
- Streamline release coordination with automated insights
