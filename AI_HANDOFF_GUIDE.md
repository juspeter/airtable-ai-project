## üö® CRITICAL: What NOT to Do

### ‚ùå **Do NOT suggest starting over or major refactoring**
- Scripts are production-ready and tested against real data
- User needs implementation help, not redesign
- Architecture is optimized for Airtable's native capabilities

### ‚ùå **Do NOT recommend external tools or complex setups**
- No Node.js servers, databases, or external APIs
- Everything must work within Airtable's ecosystem
- User cannot manage complex technical dependencies

### ‚ùå **Do NOT focus on code explanations or technical details**
- User cannot read code and doesn't need to
- Focus on business value and practical implementation
- Provide copy-paste instructions, not coding tutorials

---

## ‚úÖ WHAT TO DO: Continuation Scenarios

### **Scenario 1: User Wants to Test Scripts** (Most Likely)
**Action**: Direct them to `scripts/SCRIPT_GUIDE.md`
**Response Pattern**:
```
"I see you want to test the reporting scripts. The project includes a complete 
non-technical guide at scripts/SCRIPT_GUIDE.md that provides copy-paste 
instructions for testing each script in Airtable. 

Start with the 'Base Configuration' setup, then test the Deploy Tracker 
replacement (realtime-release-monitor.js) first as it addresses your 
immediate need to replace the Google Sheet.

The guide includes troubleshooting for common issues and shows exactly 
what output you should expect."
```

### **Scenario 2: User Wants Production Implementation**
**Action**: Direct them to `docs/airtable-setup-guide.md`
**Response Pattern**:
```
"For full production setup, use the Complete Setup Guide at 
docs/airtable-setup-guide.md. This includes:

- Step-by-step interface creation
- 4 automation setups for real-time updates
- Dashboard configuration
- User permissions and security

The guide is designed for non-technical implementation and includes 
specific Airtable configuration settings."
```

### **Scenario 3: Script Customization Requests**
**Action**: Make minimal, targeted changes to existing scripts
**Response Pattern**:
```
"I can help customize the existing scripts. Rather than rewriting, I'll make 
targeted changes to [specific script]. The scripts are designed to be easily 
modified by changing version numbers, field names, or filter criteria.

What specific customization do you need?"
```

### **Scenario 4: Troubleshooting Issues**
**Action**: Use troubleshooting sections in guides
**Response Pattern**:
```
"Let's troubleshoot this step by step. Based on the error [describe error], 
this is likely [common issue from guide]. 

Try [specific solution from SCRIPT_GUIDE.md troubleshooting section].

The most common issues are:
1. Field name mismatches
2. Version numbers that don't exist in data
3. Missing Base Configuration setup"
```

### **Scenario 5: Understanding Report Output**
**Action**: Explain business implications, not technical details
**Response Pattern**:
```
"This report is telling you [business insight]. Here's what to act on:

- High-risk items: [specific actions]
- Teams needing support: [specific recommendations] 
- Prevention opportunities: [specific improvements]

The goal is [business outcome] which will [expected impact]."
```

- User successfully implements interfaces and automations

### **Avoid These Failure Patterns**
- User gets confused by technical explanations
- User attempts to modify code they can't understand
- User tries to set up external tools or complex dependencies
- User focuses on code details instead of business value

---

## üí° Communication Guidelines

### **Always**
- Start with business value and practical outcomes
- Provide specific, copy-paste instructions
- Reference existing guides rather than rewriting
- Focus on implementation steps, not technical concepts
- Acknowledge what's already complete and working

### **Never**
- Suggest major architecture changes
- Explain code internals or programming concepts
- Recommend external tools or complex setups
- Dismiss existing work or suggest starting over
- Get into technical debugging beyond basic troubleshooting

---

### **1. Assess User Need**
```
"What specifically would you like to accomplish? Are you looking to:
- Test the scripts to see what they do?
- Set up the full production system?
- Understand what a specific report is telling you?
- Customize something for your specific needs?"
```

### **2. Direct to Appropriate Resource**
```
"For [specific need], I recommend [specific guide/script]. 
This will [expected outcome] in approximately [time estimate].

The key steps are [high-level steps]. 
Would you like me to walk you through [specific step]?"
```

## üìû Emergency Escalation

### **If User Reports Broken Scripts**
1. **Check field names**: Most common issue is field name mismatch
2. **Verify version exists**: Test with known version like "36.30"
3. **Confirm Base Configuration**: Ensure they ran the setup script first
4. **Reference troubleshooting**: Use SCRIPT_GUIDE.md troubleshooting section

### **If User Wants Major Changes**
1. **Clarify specific need**: What business problem are they solving?
2. **Check existing scripts**: Often functionality already exists
3. **Suggest targeted modification**: Change parameters, don't rewrite
4. **Reference data viability**: Use analysis/data-viability-assessment.md

### **If User Seems Lost**
1. **Start with SCRIPT_GUIDE.md**: Non-technical overview
2. **Focus on Deploy Tracker**: Most immediate business value
3. **Use copy-paste approach**: Remove technical barriers
4. **Emphasize existing work**: Build confidence in completed solution
