:mag_right: Heads-up: We’ll be starting pre-cert testing this weekend, and would ideally like all final calendar promotions in place before testing begins, if possible. We’re targeting cert submission on INSERT_CertDayandDATE.

>:warning: Additional Reminders for Calendar Integrations:
• Remove leak-sensitive data from any calendars checked into the client-events channel. Leakers may have access to this data up to two hours before a scheduled event goes live.
• If your calendar event is set to go live with INSERT_BranchVersion, ensure the start time aligns with the downtime window (INSERT_Downtime ET). Mismatched start times may disrupt internal QA coverage during deployment.

We'll have a follow up check-in with calendar owners closer to deploy, but flagging now to ensure this process is on your radar.
